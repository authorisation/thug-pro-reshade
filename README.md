_**Note:** You can apply many more crazy effects that aren't shown here._

## Installation

Copy the contents of this repository's `THUG Pro` directory into your computer's `THUG Pro` directory (check `%appdata%/Local/THUG Pro`).

## Usage

When you open the game, the effects will be loaded.
Open the reshade menu with the Home key to enable/edit/disable shaders.
Most effects can be temporarily disabled by pressing the Scroll Lock key.

## Special Thanks:
* Edem (for sending me his reshade configuration and helping me recover lost files)
* Rav (for getting the DLL injection to work when upgrading to reshade 3)
* AK (for providing updated screenshots)
